Git tag (0.1.001) not applied at this stage as code changes are required to allow new format to correspond to version in executable file.
Will soon have newest ls-mgr to start tagging.


API Tests:
----------

Most tests are pending to be reviewed for validity.

Routing.- All tests pass. Waiting for caching test and new_bootstrap_endpoint test.

PD.- Experimental showed this tests failing:
PdTest.FUNC_ChunkCorruption
PdTest.FUNC_ChunkDeletion
PdTest.FUNC_ChunkDeletionForMultipleClients
PdTest.FUNC_ChunkSharing
PdTest.FUNC_RcsOrder
PdTest.FUNC_RemoteChunkStore
PdTest.FUNC_SynchronisationAndPruning
Changes to bootstrapping handling will probably correct some.

Lifestuff.- Working tests when run individually:
FUNC_CreateLogoutLoginLogout
FUNC_ChangeCredentials
FUNC_ChangePinAndPasswordSimultaneously
FUNC_ChangeKeywordAndPasswordSimultaneously
FUNC_ChangePinAndKeywordSimultaneously
FUNC_CreateInvalidUsers
FUNC_TryChangeCredentialsToInvalid
FUNC_ChangeCredentialsWhenLoggedOut
FUNC_LogInFromTwoPlaces
FUNC_LogInAfterCreateUser
FUNC_CreateSameUserSimultaneously
Two issues have been raised regarding vault network teardown and key storing on tests. 19 more tests failing.


Manual tests:
-------------

Setting up a network with script/manually works. However, the network becomes unusable after creating several users.
command line lifestuff and lifestuff can create a user, a public id, mount a drive and quit on Linux.
Windows has a problem joining created vaults to the network. User creation failing as with the installed version.

Continuous Integration:
-----------------------

Machines running CI on: Windows 7 64 and 32 bits, Ubuntu 12.04 64 and 32 bits.
