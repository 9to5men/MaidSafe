Manual tests:
-------------

Setting up a network with script/manually works. However, the network becomes unusable after creating several users.
command line lifestuff and lifestuff can create a user, a public id, mount a drive and quit on Linux.
Windows now creates a user on a local network. Tests with QA network pending.

Continuous Integration:
-----------------------

Machines running CI on: Windows 7 64 and 32 bits, Ubuntu 12.04 64 and 32 bits.
